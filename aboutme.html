			<h4>
				Simple beginnings
			</h4>
			<p>
				My initial contact with programming and computer science in general started in the winter of 2018. It
				was winter break and my uncle(Who currently works at microsoft) came over for the weekend. On the night
				of his second day, he explained the basics of computer science and memory in 3 hours. I was absolutely
				amazed at how a complex creation like a computer is based on simple principles at its foundation. He
				also introduced me into C on the very night and intrigued me. I didn't know it then but that was one of
				the best presents I got for the holiday.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Starting of a new journey
			</h4>
			<p>
				I could tell you that I was so impressed that I spent the entire week locked up in my room, learning how
				to code C and made the next Microsoft, but that would be nowhere near the truth. A journey to mastery in
				any skill is a long and hard process that has its success built on oneâ€™s determination and perseverance.
				My story is nothing less than that. My initial journey to programming had more stops than progress. The
				next time I tried to code was months later when I pushed myself to make something simple like a security
				system. This persuaded me to take the CS Principles course for 2019-2020. To be fair, this course taught
				close to nothing(other than how to use JS) but it provided allocated time to program. This is the sole
				reason that I am able to code and more importantly have the patience to learn new things. Only time can
				show where my journey will take me.
			</p>
			<h4>
				What's soon to come?
			</h4>
			<p>
				My plan is to learn API and MySQL to integrate the internet in my projects. I want to learn Brain.js to
				allow myself to integrate machine learning and get a grasp on that subject. I will learn C# and use
				unity to make some games as a way to show how much experience i am getting. I want to make a maze game
				as my first major unity game use machine learning to test a few things and have fun.
